# ALL ABOUT MNIST

## Tussle for the podium

In the ClassifyKannada37.ipynb notebook, we have three 'algorithms' in the ring -

* Average Baseline
* RandomForest
* ResNet-18

All of them are aiming for the top spot at the simple task of classifying 3 and 7. Of course, it is not MNIST but __Kannada MNIST__.
The dataset from Kaggle is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/higgstachyon/kannada-mnist)

## The Shuffle Experiment

This experiment is very minor addition to [Vinayak Nayak's notebook](https://github.com/ElisonSherton/fastbook_sessions/blob/master/ch4MNIST_basics/SGD_with_MNIST.ipynb). 

In TheShuffleExperiment.ipynb notebook, we are basically trying to see the importance of shuffle. So very interesting results.
The dataset from Kaggle is __Devnagari Handwritten Dataset__. Check it out [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ashokpant/devanagari-character-dataset).
