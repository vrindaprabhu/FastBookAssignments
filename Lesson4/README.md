# Tussle for the podium

In the notebook, we have three 'algorithms' in the ring -

* Average Baseline
* RandomForest
* ResNet-18

All of them are aiming for the top spot at the simple task of classifying 3 and 7. Of course, it is not MNIST but __Kannada MNIST__.
The dataset from Kaggle is available [here].(https://www.kaggle.com/higgstachyon/kannada-mnist)
