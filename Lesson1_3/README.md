Created a classifier for Indian Foods using the Food20 Dataset from Kaggle.The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cdart99/food20dataset).  
Uses basic ResNet-34.

Note that there is no confidence thresholding applied in inference **AND** no unknown classes, so expect any image to be one of the 18 classes.
